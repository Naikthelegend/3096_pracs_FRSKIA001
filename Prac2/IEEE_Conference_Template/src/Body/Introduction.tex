\section{Introduction}
This report covers an investigation into the topics of emulation, benchmarking, and optimization in embedded systems development.
The aim is to uncover the impact of the chosen high-level language, compiler flags, bit widths, and multi-threading on a program's performance.

Emulation is a useful tool that allows the simulation of hardware and software simultaneously,
and benchmarking is used to give a reference frame for all the tests.
Python is chosen as our Golden Measure for these tests for its simplicity while the C code is optimized to increase the speed of the program.

Optimizations are tools used during the compiling process that are designed to improve program performance in one or more key aspects.
These optimizations include changing the number of bits that the variables are stored in, adding various optimization flags and the use of multi-threading.
% \linebreak stretches the line that is broken to the end of the column.  Use "\\" or "\newline" if you don't want it to do this.
