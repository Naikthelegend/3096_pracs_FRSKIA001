\section{Methodology}

\subsection{Hardware}
The hardware used for this practical was a macOS laptop running Virtual Box with 4 CPU cores and 8 Gb of RAM. The Virtual Box was running Ubuntu image, which was in turn simulating a Raspberry Pi emulator. The Raspberry Pi emulator was used for the tests.

\subsection{Implementation}
The following code is the sudo code format of the two files: the python code which was used as the benchmark for the C code tests and the non-threaded C code.
The third file that was used in this test was a multi-threaded version of the C code file.
The \text{'data'} and \text{'carrier'} arrays are predefined arrays found in another tile

%Sudo
\begin{Cpp}
 # Load data arrays from external file
 Load data from external file

 # Define values
 c = carrier array
 d = data array
 result = empty array

 # Main function
 function main():
 Display "There are " + length of c + " samples"
 Display "using type " + type of first element in data array
 Call Timing.startlog()
 for i from 0 to length of c - 1:
 Append c[i] * d[i] to result array
 Call Timing.endlog()
 }
\end{Cpp}

\begin{Cpp}
 nano makefile
 make
 for i in {1..5}; do make run; done
\end{Cpp}

\begin{itemize}
 \item Matlab (Octave)
 \item GLSL
 \item OpenCL
 \item Verilog
 \item C++ (use the name ``Cpp'')
\end{itemize}
  
\subsection{Experiment Procedure}
The experiment start by benchmarking using the python code using the following code. All tests were run 5 times and then an average was taken.

\begin{Cpp}
 for i in {1..5}; do python3 PythonHeterodyning.py; done
\end{Cpp}

Following this, the C code was tested. First the non-threaded version was run
